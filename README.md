Automated NSE Option Chain Analyzer

The Problem: "Traders often rely on expensive subscriptions (Sensibull/Opstra) for data. Manual analysis of the NSE website is slow and inefficient."
The Solution: "I built a Python automation script that fetches live data via NSE API, cleans it using Pandas, and uses Gemini AI to generate trading insights every 60 seconds."

Tech Stack:
Language: Python 3.10
Libraries: pandas, requests, google-generativeai
APIs: NSE Internal API, Google Sheets API
